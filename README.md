## This Project is in beta, use at your own risk.

Carrot is an experimental protocol building upon the most exciting innovations in programmable money and governance, initially targeting 1 USD per CRT, employs a fair distribution mechanism that incentivizes key community members to actively take the reins of governance. 

Rather than allocating a portion of the supply to the founding team, CRT is being distributed in the spirit of YFI: no pre-mine, no founder shares, no VC interests — simply equal-opportunity staking distribution to attract a broad and vision-aligned community to steward the future of the protocol and token.
